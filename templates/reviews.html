                         <p class="description">Leaf Bakery is my family's favorite restaurant. We go there as much as possible and love the wide variety of foods. Even though it is gluten-free you can't even taste the difference! The choice of having an option to do takeout or delivery is very convenient for hard working parents like myself. Overall though, they have great food and I recommend it to everyone.</p>

                         <p class="description">A couple years ago I found out I was allergic to gluten and making the transition to gluten-free foods wasn't easy but Leaf Bakery has made that a lot easier. One of the biggest downsides to the gluten-free life style is the gluten-free bread is always terrible but at Leaf Bakery, the bread is amazing. All their bread is gluten-free and they make it take exactly the same. All their other foods are incredible too. Hands down the best gluten-free food I've ever had.</p>

                         <p class="description">Both my son and daughter are allergic to gluten and my husband and I have trouble finding good food for them sometimes but Leaf Bakery has made it a lot easier. My kids can eat gluten-free and my husband and I still love the food. There is hardly any difference in taste. The other difficult thing for us is finding good bread to use so whenever we need bread we just order some bread online and pick it up and have great gluten-free bread that tastes exactly the same as regular bread. If you are reading this review I suggest you give this restaurant a try.</p>
